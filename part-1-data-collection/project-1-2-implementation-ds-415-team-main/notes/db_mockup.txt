NOTES
--------------------
Apparently Mongo 3.0 is outdated, need 4.0 for zstd compression (newtork).
Able to use zlib or Snappy compression (zlib is more intensive)
We are on 3.6.8

Twitter (SAMPLED)
--------------------
This collection has all tweets from the sample stream with no filtering whatsoever. Contains a data field with the tweet. Meta data will be added in a different collection after analysis has been conducted.

Twitter (Filtered)
--------------------
This collection contains tweets from the sample stream with filtering for the list of keywords that we wish to search for. Meta data will be added in a different collection after analysis has been conducted.

Reddit (Posts)
--------------------
Reddit posts will be added from various subreddits and, importantly, their titles and text(if available) will be stored. Meta data will be added in a different collection after analysis has been conducted.

Reddit (Comments)
--------------------
Reddit comments will be added from various subreddits their text and corresponding post will be stored. Meta data will be added in a different collection after analysis has been conducted.
